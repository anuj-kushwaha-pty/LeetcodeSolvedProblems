# [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

### Description

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.


## Constraints

- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= height[i] <= 105

## Examples

### Example 1

<img width="412" height="161" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5edc5c03-4318-409f-9650-235f19f66f9d" />

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

Output: 6

Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
