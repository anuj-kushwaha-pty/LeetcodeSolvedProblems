# [Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

### Description

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.

## Examples

### Example 1
Input: s = "a good   example"

Output: "example good a"

Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
