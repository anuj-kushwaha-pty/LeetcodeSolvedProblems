# [Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-integer-to-the-sum-of-two-no-zero-integers/)

### Description

No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

## Constraints

- 2 <= n <= 10^4

## Examples

### Example 1
Input: n = 2

Output: [1,1]

Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.
