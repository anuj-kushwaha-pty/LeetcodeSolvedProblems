**Description**

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product. The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.


##Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


##Examples
